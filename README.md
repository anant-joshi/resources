## Unit Testing
### What is Unit Testing?
Unit Testing is the practice of testing certain logical units of functionality
in your code. It gives us the ability to verify that each _unit_ of the code
works as intended.  
Unit tests may be written for individual functions, or parts of functionality
encompassing several methods or even classes.

### What exactly is a unit test supposed to do?
A unit test is supposed to automate the performing certain actions, or provide
certain input to the _unit_ that is being _tested_, and match that with a
specific output, or outcome.

### Why should I write tests?
Unit tests may seem like more work to do, but in the long run, will save you
several hours, if not days of work. They allow you to ensure that the test
cases are valid for every version of the software, reducing debugging, and
testing time.

### Advantages of Unit Testing
- It is automated, and thus allows you to not have to manually test, later
- It saves time, since a test written once is useful throughout
- Tests can range from extremely simple to extremely sophisticated use-cases,
making them flexible

### When to not write unit tests
Unit tests need not be written, when the application being built is trivially
simple, and writing tests would be a significant fraction of the development
time

### Incorporating Unit Testing into your Development Workflow
Unit testing is continuous work, and should be done when writing the module
itself. This is the best time to write the test, as you are clearest with the
logic of the module.

### Misc
[Writing testable code](https://www.toptal.com/qa/how-to-write-testable-code-and-why-it-matters)  
This is a nice guide on writing clean, testable, and maintainable code, as well
as writing good tests to go along with it


### Django Test Framework

#### Introduction

Django comes with useful extensions to Python's testing suite. It is a useful
tool for killing bugs, ensuring existing functionality works, when adding new
components, and validating logic.  
Unit Testing in Django includes HTTP simulation, template rendering, view
processing, database operations, and so much more. Most importantly, all this
complex functionality is made extremely *easy*.

#### Writing Tests

- Django's unit tests are derived from Python's `unittest` module.

- Each test is a separate class, which extends `django.test.TestCase`.
By convention, each TestCase class is named with the name of the test, followed
by 'TestCase', e.g. `LoginRegisterTestCase`

- Each test case runs as an isolated transaction, i.e. it does not have any
permanant effects, or changes on the external environment.

- Each `TestCase` has a function called `setUp`, that should be
overridden to perform any actions that occur before each test case runs.

- The `setUp` function can perform actions such as making database entries,
creating and logging in a user, etc. It can also be used to initialize the test
`client`.

- Each test function is _required_ to begin with the word `test`, e.g.
`test_login_failure`. Each test function runs in the order it is written in the
class.

- An example of a `TestCase` is given below.

```python
class AddItemTestCase(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.factory = RequestFactory()

    def test_add_item(self):
        request_dict = {
            'itemtype': 'Book',
            'title': 'Cormen',
            'year': 'SE',
            'department': 'COMPS',
            'author': 'Cormen',
            'publisher': 'Pearson',
            'description': 'Kaafi sahi',
            'maxprice': 1000,
            'subject': 'Algorithms',
        }
        response = self.client.post(
            '/store/add-new-items/',
            request_dict,
        )
        self.assertEquals(response.status_code, 302)
        query_list = Item.objects.filter(title__contains="Cormen")
        if not query_list:
            self.assertFalse(True)
```

#### Testing Tools

The Django Test framework contains _several_ tools for writing effective, and
efficient tests. Covering all these tools is not possible in the scope of this
section. The following are some of the most important tools in the test
framework.

##### The Test Client

The test client is a python class that acts as a dummy web-browser, allowing
you to test your views, and interact with the django-webapp interactively.

Some of the things that can be done with the test client are:
- Simulating GET and POST requests, and observing the response.
- See the redirects, and their associated values.
- Check and test rendered Templates, and their contexts
  
The test client is of the class `django.test.Client`. The Django Test client is
 present in a `TestCase` by default.  
You can read more about the test client [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/tools/#the-test-client)

##### Assertions

Assertions are one of the most important parts of a unit test. Assertions allow
you to assert that a particular condition occurs, or not. Each test must end
with an assertion, to check it's validity. A test may contain one or more
assertion.  
Assertions are a part of Python, but Django extends this functionality with
several types of assertions, to reduce the amount of code written.
  
Read more about assertions [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/tools/#assertions)

#### Running Tests

- All tests should be in a file in your app called `test*.py`, where `*` denotes
any number (including zero) of characters in the file (e.g. `tests_module.py`)

- Tests are run from the command line as `python manage.py test <folder_name>`.
(Note: It checks only in the directory, and not subdirectories)
- A good practice is to have at least one `test*.py` file for each app.
